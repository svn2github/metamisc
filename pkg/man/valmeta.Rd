\title{
Meta-analysis of prediction model performance
}
\description{
This function allows to meta-analyze the performance of a prediction model, and to obtain summary estimates of the c-statistic, the total observed-expected ratio and the calibration slope. Where appropriate, data transformations are applied and missing information is derived from available quantities.

  \item{method}{character string specifying whether a fixed- or a random-effects model should be fitted. A fixed-effects model is fitted when using \code{method="FE"}. Random-effects models are fitted by setting method equal to one of the following: \code{"REML"} (Default), \code{"DL"}, \code{"HE"}, \code{"SJ"}, \code{"ML"}, \code{"EB"}, \code{"HS"}, \code{"GENQ"} or \code{"BAYES"}. See 'Details'.}
  \item{knha}{logical specifying whether the method by Knapp and Hartung (2003) should be used for adjusting test statistics and confidence intervals (default is TRUE). Type '\code{?rma}' for more details.}
  \item{verbose}{if TRUE then messages generated during the fitting process will be displayed.}
  \item{scale.c}{character string specifying whether the meta-analysis should use transformed values of the c-statistic and the corresponding standard error. Options are \code{scale="logit"} (logistic transformation) or \code{"identity"} (no transformation).}
  \item{scale.oe}{character string specifying whether the meta-analysis should use transformed values of the total observed:expected ratio and the corresponding standard error. Options are \code{scale="log"} (log transformation) or \code{"identity"} (no transformation).}
  \item{slab}{optional vector with labels for the \emph{k} studies.}
  \item{n.chains}{the number of chains to use in the Gibbs sampler (\code{method="BAYES"}). More chains will improve the sensitivity of the convergence diagnostic, but will cause the simulation to run more slowly. The default number of chains is 4.}
  \item{pars}{A list with additional arguments.  The following parameters configure the MCMC sampling procedure:  \code{hp.mu.mean} (mean of the prior distribution of the random effects model, defaults to 0), \code{hp.mu.var} (variance of the prior distribution of the random effects model, defaults to 1E6), \code{hp.tau.min} (minimum value for the between-study standard deviation, defaults to 0), \code{hp.tau.max} (maximum value for the between-study standard deviation, defaults to 2), \code{method.restore.c.se} (method for restoring missing estimates for the standard error of the c-statistic. So far, only \code{"Newcombe.2"} and \code{"Newcombe.4"} are supported. These methods have been described by Newcombe in 2006.)}
  \item{\ldots}{Additional arguments that are passed to \code{rma} or \code{runjags} (if \code{method="BAYES"}).}
}
\details{
Unless specified otherwise, all meta-analysis models assume random effects and are fitted  using restricted maximum likelihood estimation with the \code{metafor} package (Viechtbauer 2010).  Further, confidence intervals for the average performance are based on the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method, to better account for the uncertainty in the estimated between-study heterogeneity (Debray 2016). A Bayesian meta-analysis can be performed by specifying \code{method="BAYES"}. In that case, the R packages \code{runjags} and \code{rjags} must be installed. Details on the prior distributions and assumptions are provided below.


\bold{Meta-analysis of the concordance statistic (c-statistic)}

The c-statistic is a measure of discrimination, and indicates the ability of a prediction model to distinguish between patients developing and not developing the outcome. The c-statistic typically ranges from 0.5 (no discriminative ability) to 1 (perfect discriminative ability). A meta-analysis for the c-statistic will be performed if the c-statistics (\code{cstat}) and their respective standard errors (\code{cstat.se}) are defined. For studies where the standard error is unknown, it can be derived from the 95\% confidence interval, or from \code{cstat}, \code{O} and \code{N} (Newcombe 2006). By default, c-statistics are rescaled using the logit transformation to improve the validity of Normality assumptions.

\bold{Mta-analysis of the total observed versus expected ratio (O:E ratio)}

The total O:E ratio provides a rough indication of the overall model calibration (across the entire range of predicted risks). By default, O:E ratios are rescaled using the (natural) log transformation to improve the validity of Normality assumptions. If the standard error of the O:E ratio is not provided, it can be approximated from the 95\% confidence interval. Alternatively, if the number of expected events is treated as a fixed constant, the standard error can be derived from the error variance of the binomial or Poisson (if \code{O} << \code{N}) distribution. In that case, continuitiy corrections are applied for studies where \code{E=0} (if \code{scale.oe = "identity"}) or \code{O=0} (if \code{scale.oe = "log"}) by adding 0.5 to \code{O}, \code{E} and \code{N}. Finally, the O:E ratio and its standard error can also be derived from the calibration-in-the-large statistic. Standard errors are always prioritized as source of within-study variability in case multiple sources are available (e.g. from confidence intervals).   


\bold{Bayesian meta-analysis}

For Bayesian meta-analysis models that involve the Gibbs sampler (\code{method="BAYES"}), the R packages \code{runjags} and \code{rjags} must be installed.
