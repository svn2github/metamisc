\title{
Meta-analysis of prediction model performance
}
\description{
This function allows to meta-analyze the performance of a prediction model, and to obtain summary estimates of the c-statistic, the total observed-expected ratio and the calibration slope. Where appropriate, data transformations are applied and missing information is derived from available quantities.

}
\details{
Unless specified otherwise, all meta-analysis models assume random effects and are fitted  using restricted maximum likelihood estimation with the \code{metafor} package (Viechtbauer 2010).  Further, confidence intervals for the average performance are based on the Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman method, to better account for the uncertainty in the estimated between-study heterogeneity (Debray 2016). A Bayesian meta-analysis can be performed by specifying \code{method="BAYES"}. In that case, the R packages \code{runjags} and \code{rjags} must be installed. 


\bold{Meta-analysis of the concordance statistic (c-statistic)}

The c-statistic is a measure of discrimination, and indicates the ability of a prediction model to distinguish between patients developing and not developing the outcome. The c-statistic typically ranges from 0.5 (no discriminative ability) to 1 (perfect discriminative ability). A meta-analysis for the c-statistic will be performed if the c-statistics (\code{cstat}) and their respective standard errors (\code{cstat.se}) are defined. For studies where the standard error is unknown, it can be derived from the 95\% confidence interval, or from \code{cstat}, \code{O} and \code{N} (Newcombe 2006). By default, the meta-analysis model assumes Normality for the logit of the c-statistic (\code{model.cstat = "normal/logit"}). Alternatively, it is possible to summarize raw estimates of the c-statistic by setting \code{model.cstat = "normal/identity"}. 

\bold{Meta-analysis of the total observed versus expected ratio (O:E ratio)}

The total O:E ratio provides a rough indication of the overall model calibration (across the entire range of predicted risks). Currently, three methods have been implemented to obtain a summary estimate of the total O:E ratio. By default, the meta-analysis model assumes   Normality for the (natural) logarithm of the O:E ratios (\code{model.oe = "normal/log"}). Continuity corrections are applied when necessary by adding 0.5 to \code{O}, \code{E} and \code{N}. Alternatively, it is possible to model the total number of observed and expected events using a Poisson likelihood (Stijnen 2010). The resulting model does not require continuity corrections for \code{O} and can be implemented by setting \code{model.oe = "poisson/log"} (note that \code{hp.mu.var} is truncated to a maximum value of 100 for \code{method="BAYES"}). Finally, it is possible to summarize raw estimates of the O:E ratio by setting \code{model.oe = "normal/identity"}. 

When unkown, the standard error of the O:E ratio will be approximated in the following order from  (1) the 95\% confidence interval, (2) the standard error of \code{Po}, (3)  the error variance of the binomial distribution, (4) the error variance of the Poisson distribution, or from (5)  the calibration-in-the-large statistic.    

For meta-analysis of prognostic models, it is recommended to provide information on the time period (\code{t.val}) during which calibration was assessed in the validation study. When the time period of the validation study does not correspond to the time period of interest (\code{t.ma}), observed and expected survival probabilities will be extrapolated using Poisson distributions. Currently, extrapolation of event rates is only supported for \code{model.oe = "normal/log"} and \code{model.oe = "normal/identity"}.
