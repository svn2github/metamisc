\arguments{
\item{cstat}{Optional vector with the estimated c-statistic for each valiation}

\item{cstat.se}{Optional vector with the standard error of the estimated c-statistics}

\item{cstat.95CI}{Optional 2-dimensional array with the lower (first column) and upper (second column) boundary 
of the 95\% confidence interval of the estimated c-statistics}

\item{sd.LP}{Optional vector with the standard deviation of the linear predictor (prognostic index) for each validation}

\item{N}{Optional vector with the total number of participants for each valiation}

\item{O}{Optional vector with the total number of observed events for each valiation
(if specified, during time \code{t.val})}

\item{E}{Optional vector with the total number of expected events for each valiation 
(if specified, during time \code{t.val})}

\item{Po}{Optional vector with the (cumulative) observed event probability for each valiation}

\item{Pe}{Optional vector with the (cumulative) expected event probability for each validation}

\item{slab}{Optional vector with study names}

\item{pars}{A list with additional arguments: significance level of the confidence intervals (default: \code{level=0.95}), 
method for calculating the standard error of the c-statistic 
(default: \code{method.restore.c.se="Newcombe.4"}), and model for meta-analyzing the c-statistic
(default: \code{model = "normal/logit"}). see "Details" for more information.}

\item{\ldots}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
An array with the following columns:
\describe{
 \item{"theta"}{The (transformed) c-statistics. }
 \item{"theta.se"}{Standard errors of the (transformed) c-statistics.}
 \item{"theta.CIl"}{Lower confidence interval of the (transformed) c-statistics. The level is specified in
 \code{pars$level}. Intervals are calculated on the same scale as \code{theta} by assuming a Normal distribution.}
 \item{"theta.CIu"}{Upper confidence interval of the (transformed) c-statistics. The level is specified in
 \code{pars$level}. Intervals are calculated on the same scale as \code{theta} by assuming a Normal distribution.}
 \item{"theta.source"}{Method used for calculating the (transformed) c-statistic.}
 \item{"theta.se.source"}{Method used for calculating the standard error of the (transformed) c-statistic.}
}
}
\description{
The function calculates the (transformed) concordance (c-) statistic with the corresponding sampling variance
from aggregate data.
}
\details{
The c-statistic is a measure of discrimination, and indicates the ability of a prediction model to 
distinguish between patients developing and not developing the outcome. The c-statistic typically ranges 
from 0.5 (no discriminative ability) to 1 (perfect discriminative ability). 

By default, the logit transformation is applied to the c-statistic. If no transformation is needed, 
simply set \code{pars$model} equal to \code{"normal/identity"}.

\subsection{Restoring the c-statistic}{
For studies where the c-statistic is missing, it is estimated from the standard deviation of the linear predictor 
(\code{theta.source="std.dev(LP)"). The corresponding method is described by White et al. (2015). }.
}

\subsection{Restoring the standard error of the c-statistic}{
When missing, the standard error of the c-statistic can be estimated from the confidence interval. Alternatively, 
the standard error can be approximated from a combination of the reported c-statistic, the total sample size and 
the total number of events (Debray et al. 2017). This can be achieved by adopting (a modification of) the method 
proposed by Hanley and McNeil, as specified in \code{pars$method.restore.c.se}. Possible options for this argument are
\code{"Newcombe.2"} and \code{"Newcombe.4"}, which correspond to method 2 and, respectively, method 4 in Newcombe (2006).
