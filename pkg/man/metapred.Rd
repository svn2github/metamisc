\title{Generalized Stepwise Regression for Prediction Models in Clustered Data}
\usage{
metapred(data, strata, formula, estFUN = "glm", scope = NULL,
  retest = FALSE, max.steps = 1000, center = TRUE,
  recal.int = FALSE, cvFUN = NULL, cv.k = NULL, metaFUN = NULL,
  meta.method = NULL, predFUN = NULL, perfFUN = NULL,
  genFUN = NULL, selFUN = "which.min", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data.frame containing the data. Note that \code{metapred} removes observations with missing data \emph{listwise},
to ensure that the same data is used in each model.}

\item{strata}{Name of the strata (e.g. studies or clusters) variable, as character.}

\item{formula}{\code{formula} of the first model to be evaluated. \code{metapred} will start at \code{formula} and update it
using terms of \code{scope}. Defaults to full main effects model, where the first column in \code{data} is assumed to be
the outcome and all remaining columns (except \code{strata}) predictors. See \link[stats]{formula} for formulas in general.}

\item{estFUN}{Function for estimating the model in the first stage. Currently "lm" and "glm" are supported.}

\item{scope}{\code{formula}. The difference between \code{formula} and \code{scope} defines the range of models examined in the 
stepwise search. Defaults to NULL, which leads to the intercept-only model. If \code{scope} is nested in \code{formula}, 
this implies backwards selection will be applied (default). If \code{scope} is nested in \code{formula}, this implies forward 
selection will be applied. If equal, no stepwise selection is applied.}

\item{retest}{Logical. Should added (removed) terms be retested for removal (addition)? \code{TRUE} implies bi-directional 
stepwise search.}

\item{max.steps}{Integer. Maximum number of steps (additions or removals of terms) to take. Defaults to 1000, which is
essentially as many as it takes. 0 implies no stepwise selection.}

\item{center}{logical. Should numeric predictors be centered?}

\item{recal.int}{Logical. Should the intercept be recalibrated in each validation?}

\item{cvFUN}{Cross-validation method, on the study (i.e. cluster or stratum) level. "l1o" for leave-one-out cross-validation 
(default). "bootstrap" for bootstrap. Or "fixed", for one or more data sets which are only used for validation. A user written 
function may be supplied as well.}

\item{cv.k}{Parameter for cvFUN. For \code{cvFUN="bootstrap"}, this is the number of bootstraps. For \code{cvFUN="fixed"}, 
this is a vector of the indices of the (sorted) data sets. Not used for \code{cvFUN="l1o"}.}

\item{metaFUN}{Function for computing the meta-analytic coefficient estimates in two-stage MA. 
By default, \link[metafor]{rma.uni}, from the metafor package is used. Default settings are univariate random effects, 
estimated with "DL". Method can be passed trough the \code{meta.method} argument.}

\item{meta.method}{Name of method for meta-analysis. Default is "DL". For more options see \link[metafor]{rma.uni}.}

\item{predFUN}{Function for predicting new values. Defaults to the predicted probability of the outcome, using the link 
function of \code{glm()} or \code{lm()}.}

\item{perfFUN}{Function for computing the performance of the prediction models. Default: mean squared error 
(\code{perfFUN="mse"}).Other options are \code{"var.e"} (variance of prediction error), \code{"auc"} (area under the curve),
\code{"cal.int"} (calibration intercept), and \code{"cal.slope"} (multiplicative calibration slope) and \code{"cal.add.slope"}
(additive calibration slope).}

\item{genFUN}{Function or list of (named) functions for computing generalizability of the performance. 
Default: (absolute) mean (\code{genFUN="abs.mean"}). Choose \code{coef.var} for the coefficient of variation. If a list,
only the first is used for model selection.}

\item{selFUN}{Function for selecting the best method. Default: lowest value for \code{genFUN}. Should be set to
"which.max" if high values for \code{genFUN} indicate a good model.}

\item{...}{To pass arguments to estFUN (e.g. family = "binomial"), or to other FUNctions.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{metapred}, containing the final model in \code{global.model}, and the stepwise
tree of estimates of the coefficients, performance measures, generalizability measures in \code{stepwise}.

\description{
Generalized stepwise regression for obtaining a prediction model with adequate performance across data sets. Requires
data from individuals in multiple studies.
}
\details{
Use \link{subset.metapred} to obtain an individual prediction model from a \code{metapred} object.

 Note that \code{formula.changes} is currently unordered; it does not represent the order of changes in the stepwise 
 procedure.
 
 \code{metapred} is still under development, use with care.

\examples{
data(DVTipd)
DVTipd$cluster <- letters[1:4] # Add a fictional clustering to the data.
#f <- dvt ~ sex + vein + malign
f <- dvt ~ histdvt + ddimdich
# Leaving scope empty implies backwards selection
mp <- metapred(DVTipd, strata = "cluster", formula = f, family = binomial)

\dontrun{
# Some additional examples:
metapred(DVTipd, strata = "cluster", formula = dvt ~ 1, scope = f, family = binomial) # Forwards
metapred(DVTipd, strata = "cluster", formula = f, scope = f, family = binomial) # no selection
metapred(DVTipd, strata = "cluster", formula = f, max.steps = 0, family = binomial) # no selection
metapred(DVTipd, strata = "cluster", formula = f, recal.int = TRUE, family = binomial)
metapred(DVTipd, strata = "cluster", formula = f, meta.method = "REML", family = binomial)
}
# By default, metapred assumes the first column is the outcome.
DVTipd.reordered <- DVTipd[c("dvt", "ddimdich", "histdvt", "cluster")]
mp <- metapred(DVTipd.reordered, strata = "cluster", family = binomial)
fitted <- predict(mp, newdata = DVTipd.reordered)
